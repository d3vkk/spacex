          On Wednesday, May 5, Starship serial number 15 (SN15) successfully
          completed SpaceX’s fifth high-altitude flight test of a Starship
          prototype from Starbase in Texas.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
          Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship, SN15 was
          powered through ascent by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in
          sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee – approximately 10 km in
          altitude. SN15 performed a propellant transition to the internal
          header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself
          for reentry and a controlled aerodynamic descent.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
          Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control,
          accomplished by independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps
          on the vehicle. All four flaps were actuated by an onboard flight
          computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and enabled
          precise landing at the intended location. SN15’s Raptor engines
          reignited as the vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver
          immediately before touching down for a nominal landing on the pad.

          These test flights of Starship are all about improving our
          understanding and development of a fully reusable transportation
          system designed to carry both crew and cargo on long-duration
          interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and
          travel to Mars and beyond.

          Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on SN15’s successful flight
          and landing!
